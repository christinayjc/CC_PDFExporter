# PDF Exporter

PDF Exporter is a custom Storyboard Pro tool that streamlines the process of generating PDF exports. Instead of finaggling through multiple menus, the tool will automatically adjust the project title with the name of the SBP file before exporting a PDF. With one simple click, you will always have the correct filename as the cover of the PDF.

<sub>Version 1.0.0</sub>  
<sub>Created and tested in Storyboard Pro 22 (Version 22.0.4)</sub>
